# Cymbal Bank LOAN APP

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

To build the front-end run the following:

    # flutter build web --release

This builds the latest components into the 'build' directory. The `backend` components then reference these directory. Similar to the `Dockerfile` in the root.

## Warnings

This UI was built by the pitch hub team with flutter flow. The files in this repository is a stripped down version of flutter flow to allow us to deploy the application without the need of a 3rd-part product like flutter flow. Obviously some functionality would have been lost along the way in the process :).
